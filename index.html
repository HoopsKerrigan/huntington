	<h2><u>Huntington Website to be Inactive During Period of Police Investigation</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - November 9, 1995</h5>
	<p>As it has become evident that former Huntington Website curator Bruce Clements was involved with the crime group that led a reign of terror this autumn, the Huntington Police Department has declared the website to be a point of evidence and will bar any further updates, pending an investigation. This update will be the last for an indeterminate amount of time as law enforcement conducts their analysis.
	<br><br>From all of us at the City of Huntington Mayoral Office, the City of Huntington Technology Office, and the Cabell County Public Library System, we would like to thank you all for allowing us to share updates about the town with you. Together, we have brought Huntington and West Virginia as a whole into the future. As technology advances, so too will our lives as we become closer with others.
	<br><br>We hope to be able to move past these dark events and return to bring you updates about our wonderful city when all of the smoke here has cleared.
	<br><br>Thank you all for participating, and keep riding the superinformation highway!

	<h2><u>Be At Peace ‚Äì Citywide Curfew Lifted</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - November 7, 1995</h5>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u9GrUTY.jpg" width="35%" height="35%" title="Mayor Jean Dean addresses Huntington."></center>
	<p>In a televised statement given today from her office in Huntington City Hall, Mayor Jean Dean spoke and lifted the curfew on Huntington that had been in effect since October 21.
	<blockquote>After thougtful consideration from the Huntington Police Department's primary investigators, we have full confidence that the terror that has threatened this city for the past two months has been stopped. As such, we believe it right to lift the citywide curfew from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM. There is a long road ahead. It is one of grieving, one of recovery, and one of piecing together the truth. Even with such a workload, we feel it possible for you citizens to rest a little easier at night.</blockquote>
	The Huntington Police Department says there is a lot of work ahead to piece together the key players, the motives, and the intentions of those in the terror group that scourged Huntington this fall, but they stand fully behind their decision to advise the Mayoral Office to lift the curfew.

	<h2><u>Sheriff Adkins to Resign Following Investigation</u></h2>	
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - November 5, 1995</h5>
	<p>In a statement given today, Sheriff Ottie Adkins announced his resignation at an unknown future date, following the investigation of the violent crimes that have occurred in the Huntington area this past autumn.
	<blockquote>"I've served this community for a number of years and have had the honor of getting to know you fine people. I have met some of the bravest men and women and had the pleasure of working with them every single day in an attempt to keep this great city safe. This past autumn has been the most challenging time of my career, and day after day it has broken my heart to turn to you wonderful people without answers to your questions, without assurances to your worries, and without hope for your fears. It has broken my heart day after day, and all I can do is hope that you can forgive me. I am formally announcing my resignation following this investigation. These tragedies will see me out, and I will, as always, do my best to serve this community to the fullest of my abilities. I will not let you down, but hope you understand that there is only so much one can see before it is time to leave. I thank you all for the honor of serving you, and hope to do so in other ways in the future."</blockquote>
	Adkins has been elected to the office of Sheriff of Huntington twice, first in 1988 and again in 1992. As stated, he will likely transition his role in the community to another branch of civil service, where he hopes to continue serving Huntington.

	<h2><u>Crime Spree ‚Äì Numerous Links Between Kenova Massacre and Autumnal Crimes</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - November 4, 1995</h5>
	<p>Although they are not yet ready to release all details, the Huntington Police Department has stated that they feel certain there are "numerous links between the Kenova house and the numerous crimes committed this autumn", according to Investigator David Toschi. "There are pretty damning things here and quite literally some smoking guns."</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CfgXG6R.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" title="Investigator Toschi digging through case files."></center>
	<p>"The firearm found on Lee MacMillan, the Ale House shooter, shares a registry number as one missing from the Huntington Pawn and Jewelry, linking MacMillan to the burglary. Firearms found on two of the suspects in the Kenova house basement also shared registry numbers with firearms logged at the Huntington Pawn and Jewelry, linking MacMillan to the Kenova group and putting them all at the pawn burglary." said Toschi.</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/43UXKKj.jpg" width="45%" height="45%" title="Toschi in the morgue with Physician Malcom Weatherby."></center>
	<p>"There's more." he continued, "the hikers that were attacked in early September. One was wearing a shirt that belonged to the one victim that didn't survive the attack, the name was written on the back collar. They also kept his camera and film, which has been rapidly processed and is being viewed to see if any film is salvageable, and his backpack. It's pretty sloppy, because that same backpack and its retroreflectors were captured on CCTV footage, being worn by the lead suspect in the bombing attack on Officer Burnham."</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iGY48p1.jpg" width="45%" height="45%" title="Toschi looking over a suspect file at his desk."></center>
	<p>"There are connections to a recent investigation at the Huntington Steel Plant, but as that is an ongoing investigation I am not at liberty to divulge details on that." Toschi stated. "All I'm saying is that these terrorists are lucky they're dead, because they'd be rotting in jail for a long time with everything we're putting together here."
	<br><br>These connections are a significant update in this case, as it begins to unfog the trail of this mysterious group that caused such a reign of terror over the area this autumn.

	<h2><u>The Occult in Huntington? ‚Äì Details</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - November 3, 1995</h5>
	<p>Investigators in the Kenova House Case have uncovered numerous items they believe to be linked to the occult in numerous ways. Certain items recovered from the fire and symbology present on the site lead the Huntington Police Department to believe that the members of the terror group were potentially involved in some sort of religious ceremony.
	<br><br>As the items have been recovered for police evidence, photos are unavailable to share on this website. However, a police artist has been generous enough to sketch the items to share here.
	<p>A book written in an unknown script. The book is a slight orange colour and is bound in what appears to be some sort of leather.</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MJ4yFQp.png" width="30%" height="30%" title="95-006129-05."></center>
	<p>A medallion of unknown origin, with script that matches the book, depicting some sort of deity descending from the clouds.</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uCIL8uK.png" width="40%" height="40%" title="95-006129-07"></center>
	<p>An obsidian dagger with a handle appearing to be made from a human jawbone, also with matching script.</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RssCpyD.png" width="50%" height="50%" title="95-006129-06"></center>
	<p>A small wooden cellar containing soil from an unknown source.</p>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fF5SMN4.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="95-006129-08"></center>
	<br><br>Additionally, robes and hoods for ceremony, though no sketch was given.
	<br><br>"It's clear to see that the people involved in this were conducting some sort of Satanic ritual. These people were unwell and likely in some sort of drug-fueled frenzy when they were conducting this nonsense. It's horrible to have had this happen in our town, and it only goes to remind us that this could happen anywhere so it's important to protect ourselves and our children in these times of Satanic imagery in our media." Deputy Dwight Kovacs of Huntington Police Department said in a statement this morning.
	<br><br>We may never know the motives behind their actions or the extent to which they would go with these rituals. However, Huntington Police Department is working to pore over every bit of evidence to try and paint a complete picture in an effort to bring closure to all of us.

	<h2><u>Bruce Clements Found Dead - Honoring Bruce</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - November 2, 1995</h5>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OPxWCEM.jpg" width="25%" height="25%" title="Bruce Clements, 1995."></center>
	<p>Bruce Clements, curator of the City of Huntington Website and employee of the City of Huntington Public Library System was found dead in his home yesterday morning. It is with great sorrow that we present this news, and we hope to honor him in this article as we remember him and his service to the city of Huntington.
	<br><br>Bruce was born on November 18, 1970 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia to R.J. and Joannah Clements. Graduating high school in 1987, he went to Marshall University in Huntington for Computer Engineering and Sciences, and it was during his time at university where he began working at the Cabell County Public Library. After graduating, he remained in his position at the library and worked with the county to begin digitally cataloguing records.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7GNj0yW.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" title="Bruce as a child in Point Pleasant."></center><p>
	Bruce was an excellent coworker and a kind friend to any and all within the Cabell County Public Library System. Bruce worked within the library system for six years, starting as a desk aid and cataloger. However, as computers became more commonplace in the workplace he was always one to push for the modernization of library systems. Bruce will be missed by his coworkers and family, and is remembered by his parents R.J. and Joannah Clements, his sister Hailey, and his brothers Clyde and Edwin.
	<br><br>Visitation for friends and family will be Friday, November 4, at 10:00 AM, at the Beard Mortuary and Funeral Home. Funeral services will be held Sunday, November 6, at 12:00 PM, also at the Beard Mortuary and Funeral Home.

	<h2><u>Kenova Pumpkin House Burns ‚Äì Police Shootout</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - November 1, 1995</h5>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eBC1DKQ.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" title="The Kenova House up in flames."></center>
	<p>In a shock to the surrounding neighbourhood, the Kenova Pumpkin House has burned to the ground in a shocking display on Halloween, and two firemen and three police officers have been killed in the incident. The community of Kenova and Huntington come together today to remember the brave souls that gave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty on Halloween night. 
	<br><br>At around 11:00 PM last night, Huntington Fire received a call about fire coming out of a side window, seen by a neighbour. Upon their arrival to the scene, Huntington firefighters saw that the interior of the house was rapidly being consumed by flames and they quickly rushed in to try and stop the fire from threatening the structural integrity of the house. 
	<br><br>Ceredo Fire Department fireman Rudy Mickler gave his account:
	<blockquote>"Our station is less than a mile away so with our sirens it was only about 3 minutes before we were on scene and laying hoses, the fire was still all inside what looked like a front room, where some pumpkins were lit in the windowsill. Hopping out we thought it would be quick and that there wouldn't be much to it, this would be an easy save if we kept our cool. The fire is in most of that front room so we bust the front window and start spraying in while Doug and Pete Ford enter the side door to get at it from another side and stop it from reaching the hall.
	<br><br>They get in and not long after we hear a few loud pops, and stuff can sometimes explode in the heat but this was loud, and through the window we see Doug go down, and then another and Peter stumbles into the hall, and then someone is over him with a gun and they shoot him, cold blood as he's on the ground. The guy looks right at me, I see his eyes, and then he backs away. So immediately we duck and get behind the truck to rethink our strategy because something serious is going on."</blockquote>
	It is at this point that the firemen from the Ceredo Fire Department are joined by the Kenova Volunteer Fire Department as they radio in to their respective police departments, each located within a mile of the Kenova house. Officer Adrien Dawes of the Ceredo Police Department radioed in for backup from the Huntington Police Department, stating "Mayday, firemen down, shots fired, requesting backup at Beech and 8th in Kenova".
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CytXwO.png" width="50%" height="50%" title="Firemen size up the scene."></center><p>
	Just a few minutes pass before the two local police departments arrive, and as the agencies try to formulate a plan of entry, firefighters tried to safely fight the blaze from the outside without getting too close, allowing the fire to slowly spread inside the house. As Huntington Police Department arrived, officers had formulated a plan to enter through both the front and back doors, carefully sweeping the house for suspects.
	<br><br>Ceredo Officer Jamie Hess shares what happened upon entry:
	<blockquote>"I was with the group that was set to enter the back door, there were four of us in the rear and at the front door Kenova and Huntington had three each. We stacked up as best as we could, trying to peek through windows before going in and clearing corners. Entering a burning building isn't part of our wheelhouse but we trusted the firemen there to keep it under wraps as we tried to figure out what the hell was going on. From the backdoor to the front door there's a long hallway that splits off, so the whole time we can see the guys on the other side as we try to clear rooms. My heart was in my ears but eventually we make it to Doug and Pete Ford on the ground in the hallway, and myself and Jimmy pull them back outside to see if anything can be done for them."</blockquote>
	Having a background as a first responder, Officer Hess stayed with the two firemen offering pallative care until they passed on the lawn of the Kenova House sometime before 11:30 PM. Inside, remaining officers worked to secure the rest of the building.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YtcuGOw.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" title="Inside the torched Kenova House."></center><p>
	Kenova Police Officer George Rapp gives his account:
	<blockquote>"After they pull Pete and Doug out when we had the first floor clean, we had to move fast and we only had two places to go: the basement or upstairs. It was getting hot in there, they were trying to keep it under wraps but the firemen could only do so much from outside - they refused to come in, understandably so too. So we split, and my group headed upstairs while a mix of Huntington and Ceredo guys go down into the basement, of which the door was already cracked. So myself and three others head upstairs, I'm in spot number four behind Lynn Dynex, Mack Petiole, and Baker Waldron. We do standard clearing, room by room checking our corners and calling it out except we're on our hands and knees because the smoke is really billowing up through the main staircase up to us. Each room we clear we bust a window to help vent it was so bad. At some point Mack looks at me and says he doesn't feel safe, we need to turn back and get the hell out of the house because it doesn't feel like the fire is under control. We did our best trying to clear it out but we never made it to the third floor, we came out coughing and just collapsed, we couldn't have gone back in even though we all really wanted to."</blockquote>
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DRNSl6L.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" title="Another inside view of the scene."></center><p>
	Inside, officers had already made their way down to the basement of the home. Surviving Huntington Officer Thomas Weaver shares what happened:
	<blockquote>"So we split from the group going upstairs and we all just have a bad feeling. There are four of us: Bruce Keegan, Eddy Price, Marty Tory, and me, and we knew something wasn't right because everyone looked nervous. People don't just shoot at firemen and disappear. We stack and look down the staircase to the basement, and start to move down. I was second in line headed down and we're trying to be quiet so all you can really hear is the sound of the fire upstairs but when you got to the basement it was just dull, like you couldn't hear anything. Like the walls were sucking up all of the sound and you could hear your hair growing, that kind of thing. The basement wasn't fully finished, mostly drywall and a concrete floor, and the staircase was right in the center of the room so on either side you can look around and be exposed, not a great spot to be in. But we know we have to push and we know how to do it safely. We signal for two of us to go for either side so no one is alone.
	<br><br>I'm set to be on the left with Eddy, and Bruce and Marty are ready to swing out to the right side. There was one door and then another door to get through before you were in the basement proper - I knew as my kid and I volunteered earlier this fall. We get to the bottom step and then open into that small room between the doors, closing the one behind us. We try the second door, and then immediately there's a bang and Marty is hit, he lets out a loose shot, and then he drops and is on his side. He shoots again and hits whoever shot him I guess because then there's a yell and some crashing, and then Marty keeps shooting and it's quiet for a second so Eddy and I get on the basement level and look for concealment. We each find something and then sweep the room. I look back to call to Eddy, I was in front of him, when I hear the door in front of us on the far wall openand then I see him get blown clear, and he's down quick without a second breath. I keep down and look back and there's bullets coming my way every couple of seconds, when I hear Bruce yell at someone to drop the gun before he fires, then fires again. Someone was down and they weren't getting back up.
	<br><br>We take a second to make sure there's no one else in the room with us, and we close the door behind us but Marty is bleeding badly and Eddy is gone. Marty says he can wait, and to finish clearing, so we believe him and do. Bruce and I start to make our way to that last back door. We turn lights on and hold them forward and open the door and the room was small, it had a hot water heater and that's it, but the back wall had been broken out and past it was a sort of tunnel. Whoever had been here had been here long and they were doing a lot of work. The tunnel was lit with candles here and there, it was really spooky, and way down the tunnel there was a sort of glow, like a bigger room had been dug out. We stay low and move slowly, it's all we can do since it's just two of us and who knows how many of anyone else, and Bruce is just two steps ahead of me."</blockquote>
	Officer Bruce Keegan unfortunately lost his life in the line of duty while attempting to secure the basement with Thomas Weaver. Soon after the Kenova  Police Officers exited the building, the fire quickly began to spread through the house and the entire structure was ablaze at roughly 11:45 PM. Fearing that the four officers assigned to the basement were lost, their fears were partially quelled when Officer Weaver emerged from the front door, clothes on fire. He collapsed in the front yard and was rushed to the hospital for care. Firefighters were able to control the blaze in the early hours of the morning and began investigating the scene for cause of fire as forensics examined the scene of the crime.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DRNSl6L.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" title="Another inside view of the scene."></center><p>
	<br><br>Firefighters quickly assumed that one of the numerous jack-o'-lanterns in the front room was mistakenly toppled over and the candle inside started a small fire on the rug. This fire, left unchecked, was allowed to burn and eventually spread to the rest of the house despite the best efforts of local fire brigades. Local police departments hope to update us and the community on the details surrounding the shootout and the fire as they become clear.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/upKKFi7.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" title="The house as it currently stands."></center><p>
	Until then, we honor those brave few who lost their lives in the line of duty this Halloween and will remember their service to their community, never to be forgotten.
	<br><br>Parts of Officer Thomas Weaver's testimony were withheld at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

	<h2><u>üéÉ Huntington Wishes You a Safe and Happy Halloween! üéÉ</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - October 31, 1995</h5>
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHjo2It.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="Have a plan, stay in a group!"></center></p>
	<p>Just a brief update from all of us here at the Cabell County Public Library System and the City of Huntington Technology Office. We hope that all of you here in Huntington stay safe tonight as you celebrate this autumnal holiday. Here are some helpful Halloween tips to keep you out of trouble:
	<br><br>Remember the curfew! Keep yourself indoors after dark to prevent any spooky characters from getting at you. Remember, at 8:00 PM the curfew is in effect and it is best if you are indoors with people you know and are safe with.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nEGBU8B.png" width="40%" height="40%" title="Be in and settled before dark tonight!"></center><p>
	Stick together! When walking and having fun this today, stick with people you know and stay away from those that you don't. It's important to make sure that people know where you are and where you are going so they can check up on you accordingly.
	<br><br>For any afternoon trick-or-treaters, be sure to inspect any candy for signs it was opened or damaged, and throw that piece out! Parents, be aware that candy with signs of tampering may have been poisoned or have had dangerous objects such as pins or blades inserted.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fndXH1e.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" title="Stay with someone you know and check your candy!"></center><p>
	Stay away from the Kenova House!

	<h2><u>The History of Halloween</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - October 29, 1995</h5>
	<p>In preparation for Halloween, the Cabell County Public Library System brings you a (hopefully brief) history of the holiday we celebrate today as Halloween!
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RfqDtGQ.jpg" width="30%" height="30%" title="Costumes from the early 1900s."></center><p>
	Halloween is also known as Hallowe'en, All Hallows' Eve, or All Saints' Eve, and is likely originated and adapted from Celtic harvest festivals that took place at the end of the summer season, specifically the Gaelic festival of Samhain. Others believe the holiday to have solely Christian roots, as it may have been adapted from the Christian holiday of All Saints' Day.
	<br><br>Regardless of its origin, Halloween traditions are based in the thought of the night when past souls return to our world. Wearing costumes and masks, also known as 'mumming' or 'guising', and going door to door to recite songs in exchange for food dates back to at least the 16th century in Ireland. It was possibly believed that disguising oneself as a passed soul protected one from them as they returned. In addition, hollowed out turnips or beets with carved faces were turned into lanterns and were thought to represent the dead, or protect the carvers from them.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eKOCxpS.png" width="30%" height="30%" title="A turnip carved with a face as a lantern."></center><p>
	As immigrants spread to the Americas in the 19th and 20th century, these traditions followed, and a more modern Halloween began to take shape in the early 1900s. Over time, guising and mumming became modern-day trick or treating, and costumes took the shape of traditional monsters as lanterns began to be carved from pumpkins and other gourds.
	<br><br>Today, Halloween is celebrated by millions of Americans in numerous ways, with attractions such as haunted houses, corn mazes, hay rides, and Halloween parties also becoming commonplace. Costumes range from monsters to pop culture icons, and instead of begging for food, trick or treaters receive candy from each doorstep they visit.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pp6kpPz.png" width="30%" height="30%" title="Costumes from the late 1800s."></center><p>
	As you celebrate this holiday, think of the traditions you may have, and try to consider the roots from which they have developed. Happy Samhain!

	<h2><u>Huntington Halloween Festival Cancellation</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - October 25, 1995</h5>
	<p>Organizers of the Huntington Halloween Festival regretfully wish to inform you that this year's Halloween Festival will be cancelled, without rescheduling.
	<br><br>Organizer Margaret Brownstone spoke with us: "It was really a hard decision, but ultimately we couldn't impose any risk to any attendees and it's just so uncertain that we had to call it. My heart goes out to everyone looking forward to this event and I want you to know that I'm right there with you. This really hurts to do but it really is for the better and we hope to go twice as big next year to make up for it."
	<br><br>The Mayoral Office of Huntington suggests that those looking for a fun Halloween experience get together with family and friends in small groups to celebrate, or trick-or-treat after school before the sun goes down.

	<h2><u>Further Coverage of Huntington Ale House Shooting</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - October 23, 1995</h5>
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q82rQqp.jpg" width="33%" height="33%" title="Exterior of the Huntington Ale House."></center><p>
	<p>The Huntington Police Department has released several details surrounding the shooting that occurred last week at the Huntington Ale House.
	<br><br>The shooter, identified as Lee MacMillan, is from Oregon and has been staying in West Virginia for no longer than six months. MacMillan, 34, has been charged with fraud and embezzlement in the past and spent some time in prison as well as owing fines upwards of $40,000. It is uncertain what brought MacMillan to West Virginia following his serving time and repayment for previous crimes.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GBpFYIk.png" width="20%" height="20%" title="MacMillan's mugshot from an arrest in Boston, MA."></center><p>
	MacMillan entered the restaurant and was seated at around 7:45 PM on Wednesday night. After ordering a meal and two cocktails, he slowly ate his meal and was periodically checked in on by his waitress Donna Fairchild, who described him to the Ale House cook Ethan Bayton as being distant and withdrawn. After he paid for his meal, Donna brought him a receipt, at which point he pulled a .38 special revolver from an interior suit holster and shot Donna, then the four other victims of his attack.
	<br><br>Forensics showed that MacMillan fired from his right hand in an anti-clockwise pattern around the restaurant until he had fired five shots, before firing upon himself and passing from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hGXiOeT.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="The Huntington Ale House."></center><p>
	It is unlikely that MacMillan's actions were premeditated specifically upon the people he harmed, or to what extent he thought about his actions prior to or while eating at the restaurant. It is also uncertain as to why he was armed with a concealed carry holster while dining. The firearm registration has been matched to a missing firearm from the Huntington Pawn and Jewelry, apparently stolen during the robbery-killing on September 27 of this year.
	<br><br>Investigators are still looking into MacMillan's actions in the days, weeks, and months leading up to the attack. If MacMillan was involved in the robbery at the Huntington Pawn Shop, it is likely he is involved in other crimes that occurred in September of this year. If this is the case, it has significant implications on who else may be involved with such crimes, Huntington Police Department says.

	<h2><u>Panic in Huntington ‚Äì Keeping Calm Amid Tragic Avents</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - October 22, 1995</h5>
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4b4LsWy.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="Unassiming town."></center><p>
	<p>We understand that the increase in violent crime within Huntington has been a significant cause for concern for citizens of our city, and this article hopes to provide insight on ways to combat low feelings in these times.
	<br><br>For immediate safety, it is important for you to stay indoors within the time of the curfew so as to not be out after dark. Prepare your time accordingly and ensure you have everything you need and are on track to be somewhere before 8:00 PM each day. It is best to be inside or near a safe location you can stay by 7:30 each night so you're not caught by surprise at 8:00 PM.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UyU591d.png" width="60%" height="60%" title="You never know what is lurking."></center><p>
	<br><br>When walking, try to stay in groups and walk with intent - try not to linger. Let people know where you intend to go, and perhaps set up times to check in if you anticipate being out for extended periods of time. Constant check-ins and check-outs is a form of good communication and allows people to know your whereabouts.
	<br><br>If you must walk or do anything alone, consider carrying personal protective items such as a canister of pepper spray, a baton, or a firearm. Ensure you are following all proper laws and regulations regarding carrying weapons on your persons. Again, walk or work quickly if you are alone and consider regular check-ins with someone you know.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fL5PnXy.jpg" width="35%" height="35%" title="Stay in before dark!"></center><p>
	To help curb any anxieties surrounding the current events, it is important to have clear communication with others. Let people close to you know how you are feeling and allow them to be a shoulder if you need it. Conversely, check in on friends and family to make sure they are doing well and keeping a clear, rational head. Community will be the glue to get us through!
	</p><hr>

	<h2><u>Jean Dean Announces Citywide Curfew Following Recent Events</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - October 21, 1995</h5>
	<p>Facing increasing concern from citizens of Huntington and thoughtful suggestion from the Huntington Police Department, Mayor Jean Dean and the Mayoral Offices of Huntington have issued a curfew for citizens of Huntington and Kenova.
	<br><br>"We are in the wake of uncertain and challenging times, and there is still much work to do to ensure that this community remains safe, that is top priority. Effective this evening and until further notice, a citywide curfew beginning at 8:00 PM each night will be in effect until 5:00 AM each morning. We ask for everyone's cooperation to keep everyone safe and I assure you your civil services are working tirelessly to get to the bottom of recent crimes and put a stop to this senseless violence."
	<br><br>The curfew will be in place from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM each night and is put in place in an attempt to reduce the number of people out and about after dark. Certain exceptions can be made but citizens out after these hours should expect to be stopped and questioned by law enforcement. Businesses have been told to close at 7:00 PM each evening. The Huntington Halloween Festival will have its hours adjusted to be from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM on October 31 to accommodate the curfew.

	<h2><u>Remembering Those Lost</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - October 20, 1995</h5>
	<p>Mayor Jean Dean and Sheriff Ottie Adkins led a public memorial for the five individuals who lost their lives in the brutal attack on Wednesday, October 18. On the steps of the Cabell County Courthouse in front of a crowd of mourners, Mayor Jean Dean had this to say:
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/blqgiPQ.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="Jean Dean gives written condolences to Scott Duncan's mother."></center>
	<blockquote>"Let us not remember the one who brought about this grief but rather those for whom we are grieving for. There is no good or easy way to deal with loss. Grief is both a gift and a curse: to feel it is a sorrow so deep it can be all-consuming, but let that feeling also be a reminder that there is celebration in the rememberance of something lost. This city has lost five truly wonderful people; daughters, sons, partners, mothers, fathers. The space they have left in their passing will never fully close, the threads of them we all carry from daily interaction, big or small, may slacken. But those who have known them will continue to feel a tug on the thread with every remembered moment, every gentle reminder of them. Remember them as they were, as they lived, and as they loved. Carry that in your every day and share it with others. Now is the time to come together as a community and remain strong. Lean on your neighbour, and allow them to lean on you, and we will remain strong through community and love in a way that I know Huntington is proud to do."</blockquote>
	The memorial was held at 10:00 AM on the greenery of the Cabell County Courthouse with the families and friends of the victims of Wednesday night's shooting. Attendee and mother of Scott Duncan, victim of the attack, spoke: "It was a very beautiful ceremony and very thoughtful. You can really see the pain in Jean and Ottie's eyes, you can tell they want to do more but we're all just trying to get through this. It's, it's tough. There's a long road ahead."

	<h2><u>Shots Fired at Huntington Ale House - Five Victims and Perpetrator Dead</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - October 19, 1995</h5>
	<p>On Wednesday, October 18, at around 8:30 PM, shots were fired from within the Huntington Ale House resulting in the deaths of six, including the gunman. Five victims were murdered by the shooter and were either patrons or employees of the restaurant with seemingly no ties to the shooter. Eyewitnesses within the tavern report the gunman, identified as Lee MacMillan by way of drivers license and confirmed by dental records, as having dined alone and being generally withdrawn when interacting with waitstaff.
	<br><br>Cook Ethan Bayton, on shift yesterday evening, gives details:
	<blockquote>"He came in sitting alone and really well-dressed, and every time the waitress Donna came back to chat she'd say she hoped he was okay because he wasn't all there, like something was bothering him. She said she was feeling sorry for him like someone had just died or something, and hell he looked like he was dressed for a funeral so who knows, maybe. All dinner long he was just kind of slowly eating and staring off into space. At some point Donna finished ringing him up and asked if he needed anything else, and that's when he started firing, it was a nightmare, she was first. All of us in the back duck down and you just hear em; one, two, three, four, five, kinda quick, like, one after the other, then a quick beat and one more and that was it, no more. After a minute I look up and he's down on the ground with everyone else, it was horrible. Absolutely gut wrenching."</blockquote>
	This tragic incident comes less than a week after an explosion that killed four in Downtown Huntington. "It's getting harder and harder to feel safe, I don't know what is going on but something really brought out the crazies this year. It's getting tough to even want to leave the house, it feels like every day all fall something bad has happened." said Huntington resident Barbara Crane when asked about the incident.
	<br><br>"It is with incredible weight in my heart and on my shoulders that I must speak to you again. This fall has had the highest rate of violent crime in this city's history, and it is unacceptable that anyone in our dear town should have to feel fear when going about their daily lives. Absolutely unacceptable. This sick and twisted act is a dark mark on our community and I hang my head with all of you today in rememberance of those lost." Sheriff Adkins said in a statement this afternoon. "We may never know what caused this villain to perform such an unforgiveable act, but I know it is in our community's heart to come together to bring about a time of healing."
	<br><br>The Huntington Ale House has been temporarily closed to cooperate with law enforcement in the aftermath of this attack and has not stated when it plans to reopen.

	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xaCXaxS.png" width="45%" height="45%" title="A view of the festival, 1991."></center><p>
	<p>This is a reminder from the City of Huntington that the Huntington Halloween festival is still planned to continue with increased police presence in and around the area. "The safety of this city and its inhabitants are our top priority, and while we have had a lot on our plate recently we assure you that we will be on the scene to keep our community safe." Sheriff Adkins said in a release this morning, in conjunction with the Mayor's office. "There's not a chance we'd let the festival happen if there was even the slightest hint of a chance anyone was in danger. I give my full confidence and service to this city and our police department."
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mIwUUnS.png" width="30%" height="30%" title="A group of costumed kids at the 1994 Huntington Halloween festival."></center><p>
	However, some families have already expressed concern given the recent explosion and previous events. "I'm not going, I'm sorry to say." Eric Bayton, father of three said this morning. "We look forward to it every year but there's just been a sense of uneasiness all autumn it feels, so we're going to stay in this Halloween. It was a tough conversation to have with my kids but it's for the best. I hope things can be different next year."
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rL3uvOV.jpg" width="45%" height="45%" title="A skeleton in the parade, 1993."></center><p>
	"I don't think I want to be standing around in such a big crowd of people, not so soon after what happened. The police said it was targeted but can anyone really know? Our kid loves to sit at the bonfire every year but this year we'll just do something in the fireplace, it really isn't worth the worry. My roommate Shawna agrees and we just really want to be safe. Huntington used to always feel so safe and it feels like that's been a little shaken this year, I just want things to feel okay again." Said homeowner Jeanie Ferris when asked to comment.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HDIZovK.png" width="45%" height="45%" title="Last year's Costume Parade."></center><p>
	We would like to remind everyone that the festival will still be occurring from 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM with numerous fall and Halloween themed activities as well as food and drink vendors and a bonfire. We hope to see you there, and hope you all stay safe.

	<h2><u>HPD Gives Details on Downtown Explosion</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - October 17, 1995</h5>
	<p>Investigators and Forensic Experts within the Huntington Police Department have ruled that the explosion which killed Officer Burnham, Leighton Wallce, Addison Wallace, and Walker Roy, was intentional and a result of foul play. Several pieces of evidence have been collected from nearby CCTV cameras and eyewitness reports to help paint a better picture of what happened the night of the explosion. However, the Huntington Police Department has asked that we withhold certain pieces of information so as te retain keys for potential polygraph tests. The Huntington Police Department has not stated whether or not a suspect or suspects have been named.
	<br><br>Investigators have deduced that Officer Burnham parked adjacent to the 4th Avenue parking lot soon after 11:25 PM on Friday, October 13th and walked up the block to the corner of 8th Street and 4th Avenue into Cedar Donuts. CCTV footage within the store shows Officer Burnham order two pastries and before waiting and making small talk as the worker prepares a new pot of coffee. This interaction takes roughly 8 minutes, at which point Officer Burnham leaves with the coffee and his pastries. At 11:34, he left the store to return to his vehicle. At 11:39, it is assumed Officer Burnham turned his vehicle on, triggering the explosion that took the life of himself and three others.
	<br><br>The time of the explosion has been ascertained by multiple nearby witnesses and CCTV footage from across the street, pointed away from the scene showing light and debris from the explosion.
	<br><br>Remnants of a homemade explosive device were found and pieced together to reveal a device whose function was to deliver shrapnel upward while simultaneously igniting the fuel line of the vehicle when it was turned on. The device was "rudimentary but incredibly effective" according to Bomb Squad lead Claude Adamowicz. The device was installed to Officer Burnham's cruiser within the window of time it took him to complete his order at Cedar Donuts, with two minor holes drilled under the vehicle to access and partially drain the fuel line being the only intensive work done - the explosive device was simply placed on the ground under the driver's seat and anchored with stones, with electrical cabling crudely routed to the battery and alternator of the vehicle. When the vehicle was turned on, the device activated.
	<br><br>Police have released two still images of CCTV footage depicting two persons of interest. The first image, obtained from outside of St. Mark's Bar, depicts a man in shorts carrying a handbag and wearing a backpack walking west along 4th Avenue at 11:21 PM. It is assumed that he is carrying the explosive device and the necessary tools to attach it. Immediately behind him, a person in black pants and grey sweater tails and follows down the street. It is assumed they are working together.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/y9my9R9.png" width="45%" height="45%"></center><p>
	The second CCTV still depicts the same person in black pants and grey sweater, now without the white hat (found on the rooftop of The Tavern restaurant and partially scorched), walking along the alley behind One Plaza South at 11:38 PM, just one minute before the explosion. The two men also present seated in the second shot have been contacted for questioning.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HSZ6BkZ.jpg " width="45%" height="45%"></center><p>
	Sheriff Adkins spoke in an interview on the scene of the crime this morning:
	<blockquote>"It is very clear that this was a targeted attack ‚Äì the two people in these stills certainly knew what they were doing and came prepared. It is twisted and gut wrenching and unfortunately ended in the loss of life for not only Officer Burnham but also three others in our community. We have reason to believe this is linked to previous crimes this autumn and we also know that we are making good progress and closing in on these criminals. We are closer than they may think, and they are circling the drain whether they believe it or not. It's only unfortunate we couldn't get to them before any further loss of life and for myself and on behalf of the Huntington Police Department I am deeply sorry to this community."</blockquote>
	Huntington Residents are as always urged to report any details or leads they may have to the Huntington Police Department.

	<h2><u>Explosion Downtown - Breaking Details</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - October 14, 1995</h5>
	<p>An explosion has been confirmed in downtown Huntington on the corner of 8th Street and 4th Avenue. At approximately 11:40 PM last night, an explosion found to have originated next to the parking lot on 4th Avenue rocked the surrounding area and is reported to have been heard for some miles away. It appears to have been a relatively small explosion originating from a police cruiser parked in the lot at the time, and while the cause is not yet determined, police are not ruling out foul play.
	</p><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bJhUayl.png" width="35%" height="35%" title="Photo taken by a digital camera from a passerby."></center><p>
	The cruiser was assigned to officer Harry Burnham, who was on beat for the evening. Burnham was in the vehicle at the time of the explosion and was declared by emergency responders to be dead on the scene. Five other people were taken away in ambulances, and again their conditions or identities are not yet fully known.
	<br><br>The explosion gave way to a raging fire that quickly spread to the rest of the vehicle before firefighters were able to contain and snuff the fire out. None of the surrounding buildings caught fire, but a number of broken windows in both nearby automobiles and buildings alike were shattered during the blast, causing a rain of broken glass.
	<br><br>Law enforcement and first responders were able to contain the scene by 2:00 AM and it has been cordoned off to allow for investigation and evidence collection.

We assure all workers that no layoffs or permanent closures are anticipated, but management is not yet exactly certain when operations will resume, hopefully on the timescale of a couple of days."</blockquote>
	Official word on the details of the incident have not yet been disclosed, but Huntington Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are all believed to have been contacted by Huntington Steel.
	<br><br>Steelworker Robert Pray gave his opinion on the closure: "I'm definitely peeved but this is mighty strange ‚Äì I know Pete [Peter Douds] and him not saying anything has got me a little worried if I'm being honest. I trust him, that's all."

	Workers have not yet received official confirmation on any potential payment during this period of temporary closure but workers have said that in periods of closure in the past they can expect a week of full pay and at least three-quarters pay for any period following ‚Äì so long as the plant remains in business and does not permanently close.
	<br><br>Management and owners at the Huntington Steel Plant refused to or were unavailable for comment.

	<p>In an effort to help "keep the mood up", Maria Coleman intends to give anyone who stops by Hefty's a free pepperoni roll during business hours on Friday, October 13th. "Let's get past the superstition this year and have at least one thing brighten everyone's day. I'd be happy to chat with anyone who stops by to grab a roll."

	Opened in 1957 by former owner Larry Coleman, father of Maria Coleman, Hefty's has been a staple of Huntington for over 37 years and has been a part of many community events, festivals, and public school fundraisers. "We love being a part of the community and my dad has always been so thankful that Huntington opened up and took him in so kindly, so he made it a point to give back when he could and that's a tradition I would really like to keep going."

	<h2><u>Body Found - Likely Linked to September 10th Attack</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - October 3, 1995</h5>
	<p>As events have continued to unfold following the events of the attacks at Beech Fork State Park, county police have discovered the partial body of an adult male in waters of Twelvepole Creek near A & E's Bottom's Up Bar, located on Walkers Branch Road. Police have yet to confirm the identity of the individual, and they also have yet to reveal the details of what is meant specifically by "partial".
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BQh020i.jpg" height="380" width="530" title="The area of Twelvepole Creek where the body was recovered."></center>
	<br>The discovery was made by bartender Michael Lewis at the bar in the closing hours of Tuesday morning as he was taking a smoking break after taking out the trash, roughly fifteen minutes after closing. "I like to spend time looking out at the creek in total darkness in the early AM after close. The light doesn't reach too far and all you can do is listen, so you hear the water and the bugs and other stuff that you build up in your imagination. I'm about to flick my [cigarette] out when I hear something sorta sloshy and hollow in the water, and it just stays there repeating so you know it's stuck there. I tried to get a closer look and I'm practically nose to it when I realize it's a body, and a grody one at that. So of course I call the cops and here we are now."

	<br>The area surrounding A & E's Bottom's Up Bar and large stretches of Twelvepole Creek upstream of the bar have been cordoned off as police begin and intensify their investigation. As previously stated, anyone who may have information regarding the circumstances of this case, or suspect someone who does, is urged to come forward to the Huntington Police Department to give a statement.

	<h2><u>Black Bear Downtown!</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - October 1, 1995</h5>
	<p>Huntington Animal Control managed to capture and release a 600 lb blackbear that made its way downtown in the early hours of the morning this Sunday. At 6:30 AM, a driver on Jackson Avenue stopped and called to report a large black bear walking along the street towards downtown. The bear was tranquilized by animal control soon after and was taken in for measurement by wildlife experts in the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR), who then tagged the bear and released it some distance south of Huntington in the woods from whence he came.
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jldaMlJ.png" width="490" height="350" title="The culprit making a daring escape."></center>
	<br>"This fellow was certainly a big one, he's getting ready for the winter and has been stocking up on whatever food he can before it's all gone in winter. As big as he is, he's just a big lug and would likely have run away at any further human interaction. Black bears can act tough but are typically cowards if they have nothing to defend. That said, anyone who sees a black bear should give us a call right away and we'll get everything taken care of without any need for anyone or any animal getting hurt." Ranger Romeo Hogan said in a statement this morning.

	<h2><u>Underdog Wins! ‚Äì Cray Henshaw wins 13th Annual Kenova BBQ Competition</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - September 30, 1995</h5>
	<p>Beating out longtime winners like Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman and groups such as Holy Smokes BBQ, Buddy's All-American Bar-B-Que, and Bombshells Burgers & BBQ, a largely unknown and up-and-coming competitor won the first prize at the 13th Annual Kenova BBQ Competition this year. An unfamiliar face at the competition, Cray Henshaw managed to place 1st in the competition with his smoked pork shoulder, chicken, and glazed ribs. A first year West Virginian, Cray moved to Huntington from Alabama just three months ago. "I didn't think I had anything special, I really love all of the barbecue you have to offer and I've already become a regular at some of the places I beat out today. Really great [pit]masters and super friendly, I'm already becoming friends with them."
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qilU1a0.png" width="400" height="570" title="The new Champ at home on his regular grill."></center>
	<br>Henshaw also made sure to bring his best with his sides: "My wife Gloria does the greens and the slaw and the mac and cheese, and the sauce is a recipe my grandmother made. We really tried to bring our best to show the good people here what we do in Alabama." Visitors who purchased a plate from Henshaw were treated to their choice of either ribs or shoulder, grilled chicken, green beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, and a Hawai'ian roll.
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1B5R6FD.jpg" width="375" height="375" title="A winning plate"></center>
	<br>"This champ is really a strong force, we had no idea what to expect and being frank I'm sure not a lot of us even thought no one had a chance since Cook Cook was back this year." Brett Peters of Holy Smokes BBQ said, following the win. Larry Coleman had this to say: "I'm glad we got this reality check, it's good to have some fresh talent show us regulars how it can be done. What a way to come back, and even if I never compete again it's good to see some great 'cue."
	<br><br>"I look forward to coming back next year, and hopefully my new friends won't have stolen my recipe by then!" Henshaw said while standing with Coleman and Peters.

	<h2><u>Store Owner Dead in Pawn Shop Robbery</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - September 27, 1995</h5>
	<p>In the early afternoon at around 1:15 PM on Wednesday, September 27, Huntington Pawn and Jewelers on the intersection of 4th and 10th Avenues was held up and robbed. The owner and sole proprietor, Bishop Hale, was killed in the robbery. Items taken from the store appear to include handheld firearms, ammunition, and cash from the register. A witness on the street said they saw a lone man dressed in jeans, a sweater, and a hat calmly walk out of the store at around the time the robbery occurred. More details will become apparent to the police as they delve into the pawn shop records and review the closed-circuit-camera television tapes. At their request, we will update with more details or requests for more information.

	<br><br>Sheriff Adkins gave this statement from the scene of the crime: "This is of course a big deal and a terrible blow to the community here in Huntington, this senseless violence. I'd like to stress and make absolutely clear that there is no reason to suggest this crime is connected to the recent attack at Beech Fork State Park. It is our duty to keep Huntington safe, and while we in blue have our duty, it's also important that the people of this community not panic and not give in to hysteria. We'll do our absolute best and bring closure to everyone involved in these crimes."
	<br><br>Any individuals with any information are urged to come forward to share any details they may have.

	<h2><u>Bringing In Autumn</u></h2>
	<h5>Kylie Solis - September 24, 1995</h5>
	<p>We here at the City of Huntington Technology center are hoping that this website can still bring you autumnal joy, even in the wake of recent events that have stirred the community. That is why we today are looking to bring you some ways to spice up your fall and enjoy the season.
	<br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/W6lkPlU.png" width="375" height="375" title="A lovely quiet street in the shadow of the mountains."></center>
	<br>Try to partake in some of the autumnal festivities going on around town: several pubs and ale houses are still doing their celebration of Oktoberfest, so head over and have a pepperoni roll and a brew! Not your speed? Head to the Kenova Pumpkin house to view over 3000 jack-o'-lanterns or help by carving your own on the weekends to display. Go trick-or-treating on Halloween night, or help organize your own Halloween festivities with friends, family, or neighbours.
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RqFSQDk.png" width="375" height="375" title="The pepperoni roll vanishes"></center>
	<br>Feel the changing temperatures and notice the shortening days as the season progresses. Autumn is a period of coolness as the length of day and night varies, with night becoming longer than daytime as the winter solstice approaches. Celebrate this change by baking your favourite fall recipe such as pumpkin bread, maple cookies, or a nice steaming cup of apple cider. Wear your favourite flannel or light jacket to keep you warm in the chilling air. Decorate your home with various gourds and garlands you may find at the local farmer's market. Be creative and see what the spirit inspires for you!
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0kbnwRN.png" width="440" height="375" title="A lovely streamside view."></center>
	<br>Walk through the town at different times of day and in different weather to see things in a new perspective. On a crisp, cloudless day, feel the chill of wind from the waterfront as you walk along Harris Riverfront Park. When the clouds have rolled in, stride through historic Spring Hill Cemetery. Be respectful, they'll be your neighbours soon after all. When the rain starts to come down, enjoy a hot meal at home or enjoy it with company in any number of local restaurants downtown. Try to get out every day and note the changing of the leaves into their rich, vibrant fall displays.
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9tNigtY.png" width="480" height="350" title="Our cozy town."></center>
	<br>Try to recognize this as a time of change, and focus on how things in your life may change or stay the same. Autumn is a season of reaping what was sown, and collecting on the harvest of seeds previously planted. How have some of your goals this year come to fruition? How have you as the tender kept your goals alive? If not, how may they have withered, and what work could have been done to prevent it? Why did they wither? Why did you fail? Fall short? Don't you realize you could have avoided this? Why did you bother trying? It's futile, this whole thing, just accept it already.
	<br><br>We hope these tips can help you have an autumn that is full of the season's cheer! Stay safe and stay healthy this fall, and we hope to see you around town!

	<h2><u>John Doe Awakens! ‚Äì Development on September 10th Attack</u></h2>
	<h5>Aileen Wolfe - September 22, 1995</h5>
	<center></center>
	<p>Following a nearly week-long coma in the intensive care unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital, the hiker from the September 10th story, now identified as Lyric Parker, has made a partial recovery and is responsive. Significant blood loss and identified force traumas to the upper body and head have caused some memory loss for Lyric, but he was able to answer questions from Law Enforcement and news agencies to the best of his abilities. Lyric was able to remember things like his name and some of the events from the attack, but was unable to recall what city and state he was in, the names of some friends and family, and other long-term memory details. His immediate short-term memory is currently spotty at best.
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b1vzKUM.png" title="Parker is now responsive and on the road of recovery." width="535" height="300"></center>
	<br><br>Below is part of his summation of the events. Due to his memory loss, many of the gaps have been deduced and filled in by law enforcement and long pauses have been concatenated.
	</p><blockquote>"We were staying overnight and we picked the north [side of Beech Fork State Park, off of campsites or trails] because we didn't want to be near anybody. Sometime in the night I woke up to hear Don yelling like crazy, and I see him rolling around with his [hands at his head (Lyric gestured his hands grabbing at his head)]. So I sit up right away and get hit back just as fast by something I didn't see [Lyric pointed to his chest, where a large contusion is present], because it was still dark. I hear [Don] scramble and he gets to his feet to run away, and he's gone with something going after him. I [roll over] and start to do the same when something has me by my legs, but it feels like hands grabbing me by my ankles, and I start [kicking (Lyric kicked his legs)]. I get one loose and am able to [spin around] and see the guy who has be stuck, and I [kick] his hands and scramble away myself. I leave our stuff and don't make it far before I get tackled and then my side starts burning [Lyric gestures to his left abdominal, where some of the deepest lacerations were found]. I'm doing my best to get away and I [get overtaken] and we're [on the ground again], and just all over I'm getting hurt [it is believed this is when most of the lacerations found on Parker's body occurred], so I'm [kicking and punching] and doing my best to fight back when I really wallop him [at the head or neck] and he falls back, then runs off. I kept thinking to myself 'get to your feet, get to your feet', so I really try to get up and I'm [staggering] through the woods just [trying to get away]. At this point I'm not sure where I am but I [keep going]. I could only go so far before I [collapsed to the ground], so at this point I'm just on my hands and [knees] and after a while of that I'm [on my stomach] doing my best to keep going. I remember having to be quiet, and stopping a lot so I could just listen because I didn't think I was alone. Other times I had to stop because I just couldn't move. Just when it was coming up to be morning, I felt the road below me and started to cry. It was so long, so, so long and I didn't think I would have made it and I could only cry. I was spent, and now I'm here."</blockquote>
	<p>The Huntington Police Department are issuing a <b>community watch</b> and are asking for any information regarding two suspects involved in the attack: 
	<blockquote><b><font style="color:red">ONE MALE, ONE PRESUMED MALE</b></font>. No physical descriptions were available due to low-light conditions and circumstances of one of the victims.</blockquote>
	Police are also looking for information to aid in the locating of the missing person. A composite sketch has been included based on Parker's description:
	<blockquote><b><font style="color:red">DONOVAN, "DON", "DONNY"</font>, Last name UNKNOWN. MALE, 24, ~5'10", 170 lbs. 
	<br>WHITE, BLOND HAIR, MUSTACHED, wearing <font style="color:red">OUTDOOR/HIKING CLOTHING</font>. 
	<br>LAST SEEN in the EARLY MORNING on <font style="color:red"><u>September 10, 1995</u> at BEECH FORK STATE PARK.</b></font></blockquote>

	<br>
	Anyone with any information regarding these individuals, or anyone who believes they may have come into contact with them should immediately contact the Huntington Police Department. "We urge anyone with any knowledge to come forward, this is such a terrible tragedy to have happened and we will work to keep Huntington safe as is our duty." Sheriff Ottie Adkins said this afternoon. "We are already working tirelessly to ensure that the perpetrators are caught, we want everyone to be able to sleep at night without any worry."
	<br><br>Beech Fork State Park has temporarily closed to aid with the investigation. Current and recent campers will be contacted directly for questioning by the Huntington Police Department. Superintendent Summers of Beech Fork State Park had this to say: "We will give H.P.D. free reign over the park to conduct their investigation, and we'll give them contact info for campers and visitors who were present at the time of the attack. We are absolutely gutted to have had this happen on park grounds and we just want to ensure that future visitors will be as safe as possible. Our state's wild and wonderful beauty is meant to be enjoyed by all but in a safe manner, and we'll keep the public posted on our investigation."

	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuicmOk.jpg" width="375" height="275" title="Greetings from our sister township!"></center>
	<p>Continuing a nearly 20-year tradition, the "Kenova Pumpkin House" has put out yet another display of over 3,000 jack-o'-lanterns on their lawn and porch. The house, which will remain open for roughly six weeks until November 1st, invited people to come and carve pumpkins in the early afternoon yesterday, September 14th, and had a lighting display soon after sunset.
	<br><br>Over 2000 visitors either sat and carved or brought a pre-carved pumpkin to help bring the Kenova Pumpkin House display to life. Volunteers spent all afternoon organizing, distributing, and setting up the jack-o'-lantern display in time for the dusk lighting event, in which pumpkins were lit en masse with the help of visitors.
	<br><br>If you missed your chance on opening night, don't worry. The Kenova Pumpkin house will be open until November 1 and hopes to get volunteers out every weekend to help carve new pumpkins to swap into the displays, with food and drink carts and vendors available on weekends after 5PM. The Kenova Pumpkin house also has fine dining available for those who make reservations by calling the Kenova house directly. With indoor seating both upstairs and downstairs and a total seat count of 65, the Kenova House is happy to serve visitors in an "autumnal experience" with locally sourced ingredients.
	<br><br>We reached out to some visitors and to the Hansens to see what they had to say about the event:
	<br><br><blockquote>"Every year it just gets bigger and bigger, they're going to have to buy the lot next door if they want to keep this up!" -Mohammed Munoz</blockquote>

    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - September 10, 1995</h5>
    <p>In the early hours of this morning, September 10, motorist Isaac Frye on Pleasant View Drive was nearly sent off of the road as they swerved to dodge an oblong obstacle in their path. As they recorrected and looked in their rear view mirror, they saw that the shape had turned towards them and was in fact a person crawling on their stomach from out of the woods. Isaac quickly got out of the vehicle to help the figure, but found the person to be largely unresponsive, incoherent, and covered in what appeared to be blood. Frye put the person into his vehicle and quickly drove to the nearest medical facility, the Cabell Huntington Hospital.
	<br><br>The incoming patient was immediately brought in, presenting to the Emergency Room with numerous lacerations, puncture wounds, and several large contusions in multiple areas on his body. Surgeons worked for over four hours and were able to stabilize the patient, though due to blood loss the patient remains unconscious and doctors are uncertain whether or not he will regain conscioussness.
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/70K1WRN.png" width="600" height="400" title="Pleasant View Drive has been cordoned off to traffic to allow for a thorough investigation."></center>
	<br><br>Police immediately opened an investigation and have cordoned off a stretch of Pleasant View Drive from Red Dirt Road to Walnut Gap Road. Frye was held at the hospital for questioning by the police but was released earlier this afternoon. He had this to say: "I'm still in disbelief over this whole thing, I was just going about my work routine but it was sheer luck I was on the road at the same time as them. I'm hoping they can pull through because they looked pretty shredded, for lack of a better word." Frye has already received great praise from the Huntington Police Department for his quick action.
	<br><br>It is assumed the patient was visiting and staying at Beech Fork State Park, as they were found and picked up on Pleasant View Drive, just north of the park. Administration at the park were unavailable for comment but have put out a Bear Watch Advisory for people visiting the park. The identity of the patient is as of yet unknown due to the absence of any billfold containing any license or ID card. Anyone with knowledge or information on the patient's identity are urged to come forward by the Huntington Police Department.</p>

    <h2><u>Former Head Librarian Carolyn Esposito Passes Away</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - September 4, 1995</h5>
    <center><h3>Carolyn Marie Esposito</h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ftowSd.png" title="Carolyn Esposito in 1975. 12 15 15 11." width="300" height="420">
    <h3>April 13, 1911 - September 3, 1995</h3></center>
    <p>Carolyn Marie Esposito, 84, passed away Friday, September 3, 1995 at the Cabell Huntington Hospital with her family by her side following a battle with stomach cancer. Carolyn was born April 13, 1911 in Charleston, West Virginia, to Luis and Lily Browning. Always an avid reader, Carolyn began schooling at Marshall University in Huntington in 1928 before having her studies cut short by the Depression. Finding work as a librarian's assistant, she continued working and found her role in the Cabell County Library System.
	<br><br>Carolyn married Joel Esposito on May 26, 1934. The two were each other's lifelong companions and friends, and together they had two children: Evelyn and Raymond.
	<br><br>Following the end of the second World War, she was able to finish her degree at Marshall University, graduating in 1948 with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications. However, her love for the library never faltered and she continued to work within the Cabell County system, working her way up to head librarian at the Cabell County Public Library in 1952. She would maintain this position for 29 years before stepping down in 1981 at the age of 70, as she wished to see more of the people visiting the library.
	<br><br>From 1981 to 1994, Carolyn spent much of her time in the library doing readings to school groups and children, helping behind the counter, and getting to know anyone who walked through the door. Truly a beacon of the community, she will be greatly missed by anyone who had the pleasure of meeting her during her time at the library.
	<br><br>Visitation for friends and family will be Thursday, September 7, at 3:00 PM, at the Rollins Funeral Home. Funeral services will be held Friday, September 8, at 11:00 AM, at the Twentieth Street Baptist Church in Kenova. A public memorial will also be held at the Cabell County Public Library at 11:00 AM on Saturday, September 9.

Early crops of muscadine grapes, pumpkins, gourds, melons, corn, apples, as well as an assortment of root vegetables and greens are now available.

    <h2><u>Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman to Leave Retirement and Compete in Kenova's Annual Barbecue Competition</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - Aug 31, 1995</h5>
    <p>In a surprise return to the pit, Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman is geared to compete in Kenova's 13th annual Barbecue Competition on Saturday, September 9th, as a walk-on competitor. Coleman was the founder and owner of Hefty's Rolls, Hot Dogs, and BBQ shop. Opening shop in 1957, Coleman was the head cook for 35 years before retiring in 1992 and passing the business to his daughter, Maria Coleman. Hefty's has become a popular place for many in Kenova and the greater Huntington area and has developed a reputation as having the best pepperoni rolls and BBQ in the region. 
	<br><br>Coleman is a four-time winner of the Kenova Barbecue Competition, having won it in 1983, 1988, 1989, and 1992. This year, he hopes to give it his best but doesn't care if he wins or loses. Coleman says "I've been retired less than three years and already I miss the kitchen. Maria gets upset when I poke around the restaurant too much, saying I'm 'wasting my retirement'. I don't like to be too idle, so this'll be a good chance to pop in and see how everyone is doing. I'll be there for the fun of it."

	<br>Competing against Coleman will be previous winners such as Holy Smoke BBQ, Buddy's All American Bar-B-Que, Bombshells Burgers & BBQ, as well as other local establishments and hobby pitmasters. Tickets for the 13th Annual Kenova Barbecue Competition are $3.00 and will be available for reserve by phone or purchase at the entry gate for those who would like to attend the competition.

    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 28, 1995</h5>
    <p>As the summer has drawn to a close and autumn on the horizon, teachers across Cabell county say they are ready for an excellent school year ahead. Today, over 11,000 students from grades Kindergarden to 12th Grade returned to the classroom for the 1995‚Äî1996 academic year. Teachers are expecting a good year ahead, with teacher Edith Hodge from Hite-Saunders Elementary School saying that "All of the other teachers I know are really excited for this year; each and every one of my coworkers has put a lot of work into their lesson plans and are so excited to meet their classes [today]. There's definitely an air of good hope in the hallways this fall, and even though there's usually a grumble from students coming back from break we think we'll get them just as excited as us." Edith has been teaching at Hite-Saunders Elementary School for 14 years and "doesn't hope to stop soon."</p>

    <h2><u>Excellent turn out at Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival!</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 27, 1995 - NqFXwVQ</h5>
    <p>The City of Huntington and End-Of-Summer Festival organizers are proud to announce that the fair was a resounding success. Attendance rates broke all previous records with a whopping 17,464 attendees over the course of the day. With clear and relatively cool weather, festival-goers were treated to a pleasant day with everything Huntington and surrounding townships had to offer to them. Overall festival rating (based on random sampling throughout the day) improved from previous years, and visitors largely thought this year's festival was Huntington's best yet. With more rides and amusements, appearances by local music groups such as Hot Soup, The Citrus Man, and The Kenova Four, more food vendors, local artisans, craftsmen, and vendors, and a larger area devoted to the festival, both visitors and vendors alike agree that this year's fair will be hard to beat.
	<br><br>Some highlights from the day have been included in these statements from fair goers.
	<br><br>"The parade is always excellent, it's really great to see different groups in our community step up and show us what they're all about. Props to the Old Huntington High School Marching Band for stepping up and leading the way." ‚ÄìPiper Foley
	<br><br>"I really gave it my best in the [hot dog eating contest] but Abe Froman really knows what he's doing, he beat me by a solid six dogs and there's not much you can do about it. Abe is such a class act with a bottomless stomach, I'll give it my best next year." ‚ÄìRobbie Dougherty
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1RHxyTX.jpg" title="Abe and Robbie posing with a plate hot dogs prior to the competition." width="400" height="330"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I always love to see the livestock, crop, and grange displays. It's crazy to see just how big some of those plants and animals can get, and it's always nice to pet the sheep." ‚ÄìHeidi Bowen
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yR6Hqgl.jpg" title="Prize Winning Pig with the award presented by the Ohio Pork Queen." width="420" height="270"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I spent at least $30 on some of these fair games but didn't win any prizes. I guess there's always next year but I'm pretty sure I said that last year." ‚ÄìJulie Cobb
	<br><br>"We really went all out with the fireworks this year, it was at least 10 minutes longer than last year's. Always happy to bring the boom." ‚ÄìMike Zimmermann, Pyrotechnics

    <h2><u>Belle of Cincinnati to visit Harris Waterfront Park Saturday, August 26 for End-Of-Sumer Festival</u></h2>

    <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NGmzV44.jpg" width="480" height="300" title="The Belle of Cincinnati on the Ohio River."></img></center>
    <p>In a welcome surprise, the Belle of Cincinnati steam riverboat is expected to visit Harris Waterfront Park on Saturday, August 26 for the duration of the Huntington End-Of-Summer festival. Riverboat Captain Rafael Morris had this to say: "We weren't sure if we would have been able to make the stop in Huntington in time for the festival, but favourable weather and a bit of luck meant we'd be able to afford a day's stop at the park wharf." While Huntington was not originally planned to be a stop on this leg of the steamboat's summer cruise, Rafael stated the crew's work and the hold in the weather is what allowed this stop to happen. "The stars really aligned on this one, we're glad to be able to stop and be a part of the festival this year and let preople get a look at a piece of living history."
	<br><br>While the steamboat is docked at Harris Waterfront Park, fair-goers will be able to pay admission and board for a tour of the ship. In addition, the on-board restaurant will be open for lunch and full-course dinner for those wishing to dine on the ship. Due to the last-minute nature of the docking, reservations will not be available to be made and meal slots will be given on a first-come first-serve basis. Tours last one hour and start every half hour, and guests should expect one hour for lunch and up to two and a half hours for dinner. The Belle is expected to dock in the late hours on Friday, August 25 and leave early Sunday, August 27.</p>

    <h2><u>Reconstruction Begins on Browning-Dixon Road Bridge</u></h2>
    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 21, 1995</h5>
    <p>Following a two-week delay while waiting on material, the Browning-Dixon road bridge crossing Twelvepole Creek is now being repaired by C.J. Hughes Construction, Inc. The bridge was largely damaged during a severe thunderstorm earlier this month and deemed unsafe by WV Department of Transportation after motorists complained that the wood buckled under their cars. It is estimated that repairs and initial inspection will take roughly six weeks, with a timeline for the bridge to be completed in early October. Until then, motorists are still advised to take the Highway 52, Goodwill Rd, or Walkers Branch Rd detours.

    <h2><u>Reminder - 1 Week until Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival</u><h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 19, 1995</h5>
    <p>This is a reminder to you that Huntington's End-Of-Summer Festival is in one week, August 26th. The festival will encompass an area spanning from 4th Avenue to Harris Riverfront Park from 7th street to 11th street and last the entire day, starting at 10 AM with a parade and ending at 11 PM with fireworks. Food will be available all day from a number of local restaurants, and from 10 AM to 5 PM local vendors, artists, and craftsmen will have booths set up with goods available for purchase. Carnival games, rides, live shows, and other attractions will also be open to the public (a full list of festival events and attractions is available daily in the Huntington Gazette).
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eiM62sK.jpg" height="512" width="341" title="The 1994 Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival"></img></center>
	<br><br>Current ticket sales suggest that attendance at this year's festival will likely exceed the 1988 fair, which had over 14,000 people visit throughout the day. Fair organizers estimate over 16,000 atendees this year, and as such have prepared more activites and asked vendors to "up their stock" in preparation for the additional fair-goers. Tickets for admission can be purchased from participating stores and gas stations within Cabell county for $2.00 or at the gate on the day of the fair for $3.00. For changes in traffic patters from August 25th to 27th, check the Huntington Gazette or listen to the hourly traffic updates on WVHU Radio.</p>
