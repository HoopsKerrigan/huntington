	<h2><u>Kenova House Opening a Success - Photos</u></h2>
	<h5>Bruce Clements - September 15, 1995</h5>
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BuicmOk.jpg" width="375" height="275" title="Greetings from our sister township!"></center>
	<p>Continuing a nearly 20-year tradition, the "Kenova Pumpkin House" has put out yet another display of over 3,000 jack-o'-lanterns on their lawn and porch. The house, which will remain open for roughly six weeks until November 1st, invited people to come and carve pumpkins in the early afternoon yesterday, September 14th, and had a lighting display soon after sunset.
	<br><br>Over 2000 visitors either sat and carved or brought a pre-carved pumpkin to help bring the Kenova Pumpkin House display to life. Volunteers spent all afternoon organizing, distributing, and setting up the jack-o'-lantern display in time for the dusk lighting event, in which pumpkins were lit en masse with the help of visitors.
	<br><br>If you missed your chance on opening night, don't worry. The Kenova Pumpkin house will be open until November 1 and hopes to get volunteers out every weekend to help carve new pumpkins to swap into the displays, with food and drink carts and vendors available on weekends after 5PM. The Kenova Pumpkin house also has fine dining available for those who make reservations by calling the Kenova house directly. With indoor seating both upstairs and downstairs and a total seat count of 65, the Kenova House is happy to serve visitors in an "autumnal experience" with locally sourced ingredients.
	<br><br>We reached out to some visitors and to the Hansens to see what they had to say about the event:
	<br><br><blockquote>"Every year it just gets bigger and bigger, they're going to have to buy the lot next door if they want to keep this up!" -Mohammed Munoz</blockquote>
	<br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HtO5nwd.jpg" width="425" height="425" title="All set up and waiting for sunset."></center>
	<br><br><blockquote>"It's always so beautiful to see the whole corner lit up with all of those jack-o'-lanterns. They've gotta be careful or the whole thing'll go up in flames!" -Robin Case</blockquote>

	<br><br><blockquote>"We really love seeing everyone rally up around us to get this thing going. Who knew a few pumpkins almost twenty years ago would turn into this, it's phenomenal and we're so grateful to the community for showing up." -Rachel Hansen</blockquote>

	  <h5>Kylie Solis - September 12, 1995</h5>
	  <p><u>EDITOR'S NOTE</u>: This article was set to be published on September 10th. Following the events of that day, it was withheld but is now published here for all to use.
	  <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yUryvH0.jpg" width="425" height="250" title="Let's eat!"></center>
	  <br><br>As we enter the last bit of summer, you may be wondering what to do with any leftover or holdout peaches before they go too ripe. This peach cobbler recipe, provided by our very own Mayor Jean Dean, scales well and will keep well for any number of peaches you have.
	  <br><br>This recipe serves 5.
	  <ul>
		  <li>1 cup all purpose flour
		  <br>
	  	  <li>1Â½ cup white sugar
		  <br>
		  <li>1 cup milk
		  <br>
		  <li>Â½ cup brown sugar
		  <br>
		  <li>Â½ cup butter
		  <br>
		  <li>1 tablespoon baking powder
		  <br>
		  <li>4-6 cups sliced fresh peaches
		  <br>
		  <li>Juice from Â½ lemon
		  <br>
		  <li>1 teaspoon each cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice
	  </ul>
	  Preheat oven to 375F.
	  <br><br>Melt the butter in the bottom of a 13"x9" baking dish.
	  <br><br>Combine 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder with 1 cup of milk. Pour this over the melted butter in the pan but do not stir.
	  <br><br>Take sliced peaches, mix with Â½ cup brown sugar, Â½ white sugar, and juice from Â½ lemon. Simmer over medium heat until sugar is dissolved and reaches a syrup consistency.
	  <br><br>Remove from heat, add spices, then pour into baking pan taking care to not stir.
	  <br><br>Bake for 40 minutes at 375F or until golden brown. Allow to cool and set before serving warm. Serve with vanilla ice cream if desired.
	  <br><br>Mayor Jean Dean hopes anyone who tries this recipe can use it to bring some warmth to your table as we get ready for some cooler months ahead!

    <h2><u>Terror in the Woods! â€“ John Doe in Critical Condition</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - September 10, 1995</h5>
    <p>In the early hours of this morning, September 10, motorist Isaac Frye on Pleasant View Drive was nearly sent off of the road as they swerved to dodge an oblong obstacle in their path. As they recorrected and looked in their rear view mirror, they saw that the shape had turned towards them and was in fact a person crawling on their stomach from out of the woods. Isaac quickly got out of the vehicle to help the figure, but found the person to be largely unresponsive, incoherent, and covered in what appeared to be blood. Frye put the person into his vehicle and quickly drove to the nearest medical facility, the Cabell Huntington Hospital.
	<br><br>The incoming patient was immediately brought in, presenting to the Emergency Room with numerous lacerations, puncture wounds, and several large contusions in multiple areas on his body. Surgeons worked for over four hours and were able to stabilize the patient, though due to blood loss the patient remains unconscious and doctors are uncertain whether or not he will regain conscioussness.
	<center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/70K1WRN.png" width="600" height="400" title="Pleasant View Drive has been cordoned off to traffic to allow for a thorough investigation."></center>
	<br><br>Police immediately opened an investigation and have cordoned off a stretch of Pleasant View Drive from Red Dirt Road to Walnut Gap Road. Frye was held at the hospital for questioning by the police but was released earlier this afternoon. He had this to say: "I'm still in disbelief over this whole thing, I was just going about my work routine but it was sheer luck I was on the road at the same time as them. I'm hoping they can pull through because they looked pretty shredded, for lack of a better word." Frye has already received great praise from the Huntington Police Department for his quick action.
	<br><br>It is assumed the patient was visiting and staying at Beech Fork State Park, as they were found and picked up on Pleasant View Drive, just north of the park. Administration at the park were unavailable for comment but have put out a Bear Watch Advisory for people visiting the park. The identity of the patient is as of yet unknown due to the absence of any billfold containing any license or ID card. Anyone with knowledge or information on the patient's identity are urged to come forward by the Huntington Police Department.</p>

		<br>
		<li>The Cellar Door
		<br>
		<li>Huntington Ale House

    <h2><u>Former Head Librarian Carolyn Esposito Passes Away</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - September 4, 1995</h5>
    <center><h3>Carolyn Marie Esposito</h3>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7ftowSd.png" title="Carolyn Esposito in 1975. 12 15 15 11." width="300" height="420">
    <h3>April 13, 1911 - September 3, 1995</h3></center>
    <p>Carolyn Marie Esposito, 84, passed away Friday, September 3, 1995 at the Cabell Huntington Hospital with her family by her side. Carolin was born April 13, 1911 in Charleston, West Virginia, to Luis and Lily Browning. Always an avid reader, Carolyn began schooling at Marshall University in Huntington in 1928 before having her studies cut short by the Depression. Finding work as a librarian's assistant, she continued working and found her role in the Cabell County Library System.
	<br><br>Carolyn married Joel Esposito on May 26, 1934. The two were each other's lifelong companions and friends, and together they had two children: Evelyn and Raymond.
	<br><br>Following the end of the second World War, she was able to finish her degree at Marshall University, graduating in 1948 with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications. However, her love for the library never faltered and she continued to work within the Cabell County system, working her way up to head librarian at the Cabell County Public Library in 1952. She would maintain this position for 29 years before stepping down in 1981 at the age of 70, as she wished to see more of the people visiting the library.
	<br><br>From 1981 to 1994, Carolyn spent much of her time in the library doing readings to school groups and children, helping behind the counter, and getting to know anyone who walked through the door. Truly a beacon of the community, she will be greatly missed by anyone who had the pleasure of meeting her during her time at the library.
	<br><br>Visitation for friends and family will be Thursday, September 7, at 3:00 PM, at the Rollins Funeral Home. Funeral services will be held Friday, September 8, at 11:00 AM, at the Twentieth Street Baptist Church in Kenova. A public memorial will also be held at the Cabell County Public Library at 11:00 AM on Saturday, September 9.

    <h2><u>Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman to Leave Retirement and Compete in Kenova's Annual Barbecue Competition</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - Aug 31, 1995</h5>
    <p>In a surprise return to the pit, Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman is geared to compete in Kenova's 13th annual Barbecue Competition on Saturday, September 9th, as a walk-on competitor. Coleman was the founder and owner of Hefty's Rolls, Hot Dogs, and BBQ shop. Opening shop in 1957, Coleman was the head cook for 35 years before retiring in 1992 and passing the business to his daughter, Maria Coleman. Hefty's has become a popular place for many in Kenova and the greater Huntington area and has developed a reputation as having the best pepperoni rolls and BBQ in the region. 
	<br><br>Coleman is a four-time winner of the Kenova Barbecue Competition, having won it in 1983, 1988, 1989, and 1992. This year, he hopes to give it his best but doesn't care if he wins or loses. Coleman says "I've been retired less than three years and already I miss the kitchen. Maria gets upset when I poke around the restaurant too much, saying I'm 'wasting my retirement'. I don't like to be too idle, so this'll be a good chance to pop in and see how everyone is doing. I'll be there for the fun of it."

	<br>Competing against Coleman will be previous winners such as Holy Smoke BBQ, Buddy's All American Bar-B-Que, Bombshells Burgers & BBQ, as well as other local establishments and hobby pitmasters. Tickets for the 13th Annual Kenova Barbecue Competition are $3.00 and will be available for reserve by phone or purchase at the entry gate for those who would like to attend the competition. Competitors will have samples to try as well as plates for sale for the duration of the event on Saturday, September 9th from 11 AM to 7 PM.

    <h2><u>Camden Park to Switch to Weekend-Only Schedule for Duration of September</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - Aug 30, 1995</h5>
    <p>Camden Park owners would like to remind Huntington citizens that starting September 1st, the park will have reduced hours of operation and park entry will be limited to the weekends only. This schedule will remain in effect for eight weeks until after Halloween, when the park will close for the winter until reopening in May for the regular summer season.

    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 28, 1995</h5>
    <p>As the summer has drawn to a close and autumn on the horizon, teachers across Cabell county say they are ready for an excellent school year ahead. Today, over 11,000 students from grades Kindergarden to 12th Grade returned to the classroom for the 1995â€”1996 academic year. Teachers are expecting a good year ahead, with teacher Edith Hodge from Hite-Saunders Elementary School saying that "All of the other teachers I know are really excited for this year; each and every one of my coworkers has put a lot of work into their lesson plans and are so excited to meet their classes [today]. There's definitely an air of good hope in the hallways this fall, and even though there's usually a grumble from students coming back from break we think we'll get them just as excited as us." Edith has been teaching at Hite-Saunders Elementary School for 14 years and "doesn't hope to stop soon."</p>

    <h2><u>Excellent turn out at Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival!</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 27, 1995</h5>
    <p>The City of Huntington and End-Of-Summer Festival organizers are proud to announce that the fair was a resounding success. Attendance rates broke all previous records with a whopping 17,464 attendees over the course of the day. With clear and relatively cool weather, festival-goers were treated to a pleasant day with everything Huntington and surrounding townships had to offer to them. Overall festival rating (based on random sampling throughout the day) improved from previous years, and visitors largely thought this year's festival was Huntington's best yet. With more rides and amusements, appearances by local music groups such as Hot Soup, The Citrus Man, and The Kenova Four, more food vendors, local artisans, craftsmen, and vendors, and a larger area devoted to the festival, both visitors and vendors alike agree that this year's fair will be hard to beat.
	<br><br>Some highlights from the day have been included in these statements from fair goers.
	<br><br>"The parade is always excellent, it's really great to see different groups in our community step up and show us what they're all about. Props to the Old Huntington High School Marching Band for stepping up and leading the way." â€“Piper Foley
	<br><br>"I really gave it my best in the [hot dog eating contest] but Abe Froman really knows what he's doing, he beat me by a solid six dogs and there's not much you can do about it. Abe is such a class act with a bottomless stomach, I'll give it my best next year." â€“Robbie Dougherty
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1RHxyTX.jpg" title="Abe and Robbie posing with a plate hot dogs prior to the competition." width="400" height="330"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I always love to see the livestock, crop, and grange displays. It's crazy to see just how big some of those plants and animals can get, and it's always nice to pet the sheep." â€“Heidi Bowen
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yR6Hqgl.jpg" title="Prize Winning Pig with the award presented by the Ohio Pork Queen." width="420" height="270"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I spent at least $30 on some of these fair games but didn't win any prizes. I guess there's always next year but I'm pretty sure I said that last year." â€“Julie Cobb
	<br><br>"We really went all out with the fireworks this year, it was at least 10 minutes longer than last year's. Always happy to bring the boom." â€“Mike Zimmermann, Pyrotechnics

    <h2><u>Belle of Cincinnati to visit Harris Waterfront Park Saturday, August 26 for End-Of-Sumer Festival</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 22, 1995</h5>
    <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NGmzV44.jpg" width="480" height="300" title="The Belle of Cincinnati on the Ohio River."></img></center>
    <p>In a welcome surprise, the Belle of Cincinnati steam riverboat is expected to visit Harris Waterfront Park on Saturday, August 26 for the duration of the Huntington End-Of-Summer festival. Riverboat Captain Rafael Morris had this to say: "We weren't sure if we would have been able to make the stop in Huntington in time for the festival, but favourable weather and a bit of luck meant we'd be able to afford a day's stop at the park wharf." While Huntington was not originally planned to be a stop on this leg of the steamboat's summer cruise, Rafael stated the crew's work and the hold in the weather is what allowed this stop to happen. "The stars really aligned on this one, we're glad to be able to stop and be a part of the festival this year and let preople get a look at a piece of living history."
	<br><br>While the steamboat is docked at Harris Waterfront Park, fair-goers will be able to pay admission and board for a tour of the ship. In addition, the on-board restaurant will be open for lunch and full-course dinner for those wishing to dine on the ship. Due to the last-minute nature of the docking, reservations will not be available to be made and meal slots will be given on a first-come first-serve basis. Tours last one hour and start every half hour, and guests should expect one hour for lunch and up to two and a half hours for dinner. The Belle is expected to dock in the late hours on Friday, August 25 and leave early Sunday, August 27.</p>

    <h2><u>Reconstruction Begins on Browning-Dixon Road Bridge</u></h2>
    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 21, 1995</h5>
    <p>Following a two-week delay while waiting on material, the Browning-Dixon road bridge crossing Twelvepole Creek is now being repaired by C.J. Hughes Construction, Inc. The bridge was largely damaged during a severe thunderstorm earlier this month and deemed unsafe by WV Department of Transportation after motorists complained that the wood buckled under their cars. It is estimated that repairs and initial inspection will take roughly six weeks, with a timeline for the bridge to be completed in early October. Until then, motorists are still advised to take the Highway 52, Goodwill Rd, or Walkers Branch Rd detours.

    <h2><u>Reminder - 1 Week until Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival</u><h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 19, 1995</h5>
    <p>This is a reminder to you that Huntington's End-Of-Summer Festival is in one week, August 26th. The festival will encompass an area spanning from 4th Avenue to Harris Riverfront Park from 7th street to 11th street and last the entire day, starting at 10 AM with a parade and ending at 11 PM with fireworks. Food will be available all day from a number of local restaurants, and from 10 AM to 5 PM local vendors, artists, and craftsmen will have booths set up with goods available for purchase. Carnival games, rides, live shows, and other attractions will also be open to the public (a full list of festival events and attractions is available daily in the Huntington Gazette).

	<br><br>Current ticket sales suggest that attendance at this year's festival will likely exceed the 1988 fair, which had over 14,000 people visit throughout the day. Fair organizers estimate over 16,000 atendees this year, and as such have prepared more activites and asked vendors to "up their stock" in preparation for the additional fair-goers. Tickets for admission can be purchased from participating stores and gas stations within Cabell county for $2.00 or at the gate on the day of the fair for $3.00. For changes in traffic patters from August 25th to 27th, check the Huntington Gazette or listen to the hourly traffic updates on WVHU Radio.</p>

    <p>After several months of work and setup, we are pleased to announce the launch of our very own web-site for the town of Huntington, West Virginia. Mayor Jean Dean made comment this morning: "We are happy to help take Huntington and West Virginia as a whole into the information age. We hope to use this website and further developments in the future to help connect the citizens of this city and keep everyone informed on important events going on in your hometown." She added "Civil employees will be able to log in to access government pages as we transition to an online work environment. Government services such as police, judiciary, fire, and more are intended to be put online to help citizens easily access everything Huntington has to offer." 
	<br><br>We hope to use this website to bring news, events, and updates to users at no cost. Please bear with us as we work out technical difficulties and connection issues that may arise as we get the kinks worked out. Please feel free to report any issues to <b>huntingtonwvcity@gmail.com</b> with a detailed description of your concern.
