The house has announced it will display over 3,000 jack-o-lanterns for the duration its six-week opening and invites visitors each weekend to come and carve a jack-o-lantern to put on display.
        <br><br>"We are so excited to light up our home again and have people stop by to take a look. It really makes us so happy every year and we couldn't have imagined it would get this big when we put out just a few pumpkins almost twenty years ago." homeowner Cooper Hansen states.

    <h2><u>Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman to Leave Retirement and Compete in Kenova's Annual Barbecue Competition</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - Aug 31, 1995</h5>
    <p>In a surprise return to the pit, Larry "Cook Cook" Coleman is geared to compete in Kenova's 13th annual Barbecue Competition on Saturday, September 9th, as a walk-on competitor. Coleman was the founder and owner of Hefty's Rolls, Hot Dogs, and BBQ shop. Opening shop in 1957, Coleman was the head cook for 35 years before retiring in 1992 and passing the business to his daughter, Maria Coleman. Hefty's has become a popular place for many in Kenova and the greater Huntington area and has developed a reputation as having the best pepperoni rolls and BBQ in the region. 
	<br><br>Coleman is a four-time winner of the Kenova Barbecue Competition, having won it in 1983, 1988, 1989, and 1992. This year, he hopes to give it his best but doesn't care if he wins or loses. Coleman says "I've been retired less than three years and already I miss the kitchen. Maria gets upset when I poke around the restaurant too much, saying I'm 'wasting my retirement'. I don't like to be too idle, so this'll be a good chance to pop in and see how everyone is doing. I'll be there for the fun of it."

	<br>Competing against Coleman will be previous winners such as Holy Smoke BBQ, Buddy's All American Bar-B-Que, Bombshells Burgers & BBQ, as well as other local establishments and hobby pitmasters. Tickets for the 13th Annual Kenova Barbecue Competition are $3.00 and will be available for reserve by phone or purchase at the entry gate for those who would like to attend the competition. Competitors will have samples to try as well as plates for sale for the duration of the event on Saturday, September 9th from 11 AM to 7 PM.

    <h2><u>Camden Park to Switch to Weekend-Only Schedule for Duration of September</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - Aug 30, 1995</h5>
    <p>Camden Park owners would like to remind Huntington citizens that starting September 1st, the park will have reduced hours of operation and park entry will be limited to the weekends only. This schedule will remain in effect for eight weeks until after Halloween, when the park will close for the winter until reopening in May for the regular summer season.
    <br><br>Camden Park ownership reminds everyone that while days of operation is reduced, the park will operate at full capacity until its temporary closing in November â€” all rides, amusements, attractions, and restaurants will be open each day the park is open. For those who missed the opening of "The Rattler" earlier this summer (or for those who didn't ride it enough), this is an excellent chance to experience it and other rides until next summer.

    <br><br>Full scheduling, pricing, and ride information as well as park rules and regulations can be found on the Camden Park website. This is a sponsored posting paid for by Public Outreach at Camden Park.</p>

    <h2><u>Huntington Students Return to School</u></h2>
    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 28, 1995</h5>
    <p>As the summer has drawn to a close and autumn on the horizon, teachers across Caldwell county say they are ready for an excellent school year ahead. Today, over 11,000 students from grades Kindergarden to 12th Grade returned to the classroom for the 1995â€”1996 academic year. Teachers are expecting a good year ahead, with teacher Edith Hodge from Kellogg Elementary School saying that "All of the other teachers I know are really excited for this year; each and every one of my coworkers has put a lot of work into their lesson plans and are so excited to meet their classes [today]. There's definitely an air of good hope in the hallways this fall, and even though there's usually a grumble from students coming back from break we think we'll get them just as excited as us." Edith has been teaching at Kellogg Elementary School for 14 years and "doesn't hope to stop soon."</p>

    <h2><u>Excellent turn out at Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival!</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 27, 1995</h5>
    <p>The City of Huntington and End-Of-Summer Festival organizers are proud to announce that the fair was a resounding success. Attendance rates broke all previous records with a whopping 17,464 attendees over the course of the day. With clear and relatively cool weather, festival-goers were treated to a pleasant day with everything Huntington and surrounding townships had to offer to them. Overall festival rating (based on random sampling throughout the day) improved from previous years, and visitors largely thought this year's festival was Huntington's best yet. With more rides and amusements, appearances by local music groups such as Hot Soup, The Citrus Man, and The Kenova Four, more food vendors, local artisans, craftsmen, and vendors, and a larger area devoted to the festival, both visitors and vendors alike agree that this year's fair will be hard to beat.
	<br><br>Some highlights from the day have been included in these statements from fair goers.
	<br><br>"The parade is always excellent, it's really great to see different groups in our community step up and show us what they're all about. Props to the Old Huntington High School Marching Band for stepping up and leading the way." â€“Piper Foley
	<br><br>"I really gave it my best in the [hot dog eating contest] but Abe Froman really knows what he's doing, he beat me by a solid six dogs and there's not much you can do about it. Abe is such a class act with a bottomless stomach, I'll give it my best next year." â€“Robbie Dougherty
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1RHxyTX.jpg" title="Abe and Robbie posing with a plate hot dogs prior to the competition." width="400" height="330"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I always love to see the livestock, crop, and grange displays. It's crazy to see just how big some of those plants and animals can get, and it's always nice to pet the sheep." â€“Heidi Bowen
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yR6Hqgl.jpg" title="Prize Winning Pig with the award presented by the Ohio Pork Queen." width="420" height="270"></img></center>
	<br><br>"I spent at least $30 on some of these fair games but didn't win any prizes. I guess there's always next year but I'm pretty sure I said that last year." â€“Julie Cobb
	<br><br>"We really went all out with the fireworks this year, it was at least 10 minutes longer than last year's. Always happy to bring the boom." â€“Mike Zimmermann, Pyrotechnics

    <h5>Kylie Solis - August 23, 1995</h5>
    <p>This morning, the first of Huntington's Civil Services went online in an historic move for the city. Officers of the Huntington Police Department will now be able to log into the online portal using their government-assigned username and personal password. When logged in, officers will be able to view task lists, send and recieve internal messages, access archived records, and more efficiently serve the community. Other branches of the Huntington government will also be receiving online portals in the near future, and should expect to receive notification from their supervisors when their logins are available.</p>

    <h2><u>Belle of Cincinnati to visit Harris Waterfront Park Saturday, August 26 for End-Of-Sumer Festival</u></h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 22, 1995</h5>
    <center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NGmzV44.jpg" width="480" height="300" title="The Belle of Cincinnati on the Ohio River."></img></center>
    <p>In a welcome surprise, the Belle of Cincinnati steam riverboat is expected to visit Harris Waterfront Park on Saturday, August 26 for the duration of the Huntington End-Of-Summer festival. Riverboat Captain Rafael Morris had this to say: "We weren't sure if we would have been able to make the stop in Huntington in time for the festival, but favourable weather and a bit of luck meant we'd be able to afford a day's stop at the park wharf." While Huntington was not originally planned to be a stop on this leg of the steamboat's summer cruise, Rafael stated the crew's work and the hold in the weather is what allowed this stop to happen. "The stars really aligned on this one, we're glad to be able to stop and be a part of the festival this year and let preople get a look at a piece of living history."
	<br><br>While the steamboat is docked at Harris Waterfront Park, fair-goers will be able to pay admission and board for a tour of the ship. In addition, the on-board restaurant will be open for lunch and full-course dinner for those wishing to dine on the ship. Due to the last-minute nature of the docking, reservations will not be available to be made and meal slots will be given on a first-come first-serve basis. Tours last one hour and start every half hour, and guests should expect one hour for lunch and up to two and a half hours for dinner. The Belle is expected to dock in the late hours on Friday, August 25 and leave early Sunday, August 27.</p>

    <h2><u>Reconstruction Begins on Browning-Dixon Road Bridge</u></h2>
    <h5>Bruce Clements - August 21, 1995</h5>
    <p>Following a two-week delay while waiting on material, the Browning-Dixon road bridge crossing Twelvepole Creek is now being repaired by C.J. Hughes Construction, Inc. The bridge was largely damaged during a severe thunderstorm earlier this month and deemed unsafe by WV Department of Transportation after motorists complained that the wood buckled under their cars. It is estimated that repairs and initial inspection will take roughly six weeks, with a timeline for the bridge to be completed in early October. Until then, motorists are still advised to take the Highway 52, Goodwill Rd, or Walkers Branch Rd detours.

    <h2><u>Reminder - 1 Week until Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival</u><h2>
    <h5>Aileen Wolfe - August 19, 1995</h5>
    <p>This is a reminder to you that Huntington's End-Of-Summer Festival is in one week, August 26th. The festival will encompass an area spanning from 4th Avenue to Harris Riverfront Park from 7th street to 11th street and last the entire day, starting at 10 AM with a parade and ending at 11 PM with fireworks. Food will be available all day from a number of local restaurants, and from 10 AM to 5 PM local vendors, artists, and craftsmen will have booths set up with goods available for purchase. Carnival games, rides, live shows, and other attractions will also be open to the public (a full list of festival events and attractions is available daily in the Huntington Gazette).
	<br><br><center><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eiM62sK.jpg" height="512" width="341" title="The 1994 Huntington End-Of-Summer Festival"></img></center>
	<br><br>Current ticket sales suggest that attendance at this year's festival will likely exceed the 1988 fair, which had over 14,000 people visit throughout the day. Fair organizers estimate over 16,000 atendees this year, and as such have prepared more activites and asked vendors to "up their stock" in preparation for the additional fair-goers. Tickets for admission can be purchased from participating stores and gas stations within Cabell county for $2.00 or at the gate on the day of the fair for $3.00. For changes in traffic patters from August 25th to 27th, check the Huntington Gazette or listen to the hourly traffic updates on WVHU Radio.</p>
